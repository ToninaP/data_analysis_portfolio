# analysis

## descriptive analysis
this analysis is performed on historical data and is used to understand company, business, or organization changes. With this type of analysis, we could compare different periods within one company, or compare different companies with the same metrics. With this analysis, we look into variances and trends in our data. we evaluate performance. 

    1. Identifying which metrics to analyze. Before beginning, it's important to decide which metrics companies want to produce and the time frame for each, such as quarterly revenue or annual operating profit.
    2. Identifying and locating the data. This step requires locating all of the data required to produce the result. This means going through all internal and external sources, including databases.
    3. Compiling the data. Once all the data is identified and located, the next step is to prepare and compile it together. Part of the process here is to ensure that it's accurate and to format everything into a single format.
    4. Data analysis. Analyzing datasets and figures means using different tools

    What happened in contemporary art history? what are the most discussed topics? artists? the most important artworks? what is the dominating medium for historical artworks? what are the countries where the changes happen? 

    how many artworks were aquired every year - so we see if museums have aquisition spikes at the same time
    which medium was aquired for artworks the most? - can we see that museums prefer some specific medium? how the medium proportions change over time? 
    purchase or gift? how museums build their collections?
